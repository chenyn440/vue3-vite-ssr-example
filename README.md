# vue3-vite-ssr-example

This repo is purely a proof of concept and is not actively maintained.
For a more production ready setup, have a look at [vite-ssr](https://github.com/frandiox/vitedge/blob/master/example/functions/props/default.js)


`npm run build` will build client and server files into `dist`
`npm run serve` will run the server after building
